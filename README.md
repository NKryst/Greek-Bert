# Sentiment-Analysis-Greek-Bert
 We'll use the Bert pre-trained models in Greek language. And we'll fine tune our model by using data I was gathering since 1/6/2019 from Twitter :D
 
# Methodology
 We are going to use PyTorch as our Deep Learning library and _CUDA for GPU programming_
 
# Language:
* Python 3.8.3
* Conda 4.9.0
* NVidia CUDA


# Installing necessary packages
### (The standard ones such as pandas , numpy , json , matplotlib)
### pip install unicodedata
### pip install transfomers
### pip install torch (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ it will suggest you a conda installation command more suitable for you!)

# Bibliography:
## Books:
### Python for Data Analysis (to understand how Python is used)
### Deep Learning with PyTorch (having fun with examples and deepen your understanding)
### Grokking Deep Learning (In order to acquire the mindset about Deep Learning overall)
